Tamsyn Dexter is 18 years old and has been dancing since she was seven. She started with acrobatic dance and after a few years trained in the contemporary, modern, jazz, ballet and hip hop styles.  She has won many accolades both nationally and internationally. She was part of Chace Dance Company for three seasons and performed in "Secrets of a Family Portrait" and was a lead dancer in the next show "Humanity". She has also performed in many other corporate and charity events, showcasing her unbelievable passion and love for dance with many other individuals.


 She has achieved the following exams:
•Level 12: Acrobatics exam
•RAD Advanced 1 ( busy with Advanced 2 syllabus)
• Grade 12 Jazz exam finished with a Cum laude.
• Achieved overall dance prize for both theory (anatomy, music, history) and practical in matric. As well as the culture award.


Tamsyn dancers because there is no greater feeling in the world than moving to a piece of music and letting the rest of the world disappear. One of her most inspiring quotes are: "I don't just dance. I perform. I breathe. I watch the world disappear. I release my feelings. I lead with my heart. I tear down my walls. I stop feeling sad. I lose the pain. I let go. I smile. No I don't just dance, I do so much more."
